## Problem

Z-Image ComfyUI workflow 2025 2026 correct settings - z_image_bf16 lumina2 qwen CLIP text encoder - what latent node scheduler sampler CFG steps to use - output shows QR code noise pattern instead of image - how to fix broken generation

## Search Results

**Use these recommended KSampler settings for Z-Image Turbo in ComfyUI: Steps 6–9, CFG 1.0–3.0, Sampler Euler or Euler A, Scheduler Simple, Denoise 1.0 for text-to-image (adjust to 0.2–0.7 for img2img).** [1][5]

### Correct Workflow Setup (2025-2026)
Z-Image (including Turbo variant with z_image_bf16, Lumina2, Qwen, and CLIP text encoders) requires specific models and nodes like UNet Loader, dual CLIP Text Encoders (positive/negative), VAE Loader, ModelSamplingAuraFlow, KSampler, and VAE Decode. Load official workflows from ComfyUI templates or Promptus one-click imports for Z-Image Turbo. [1][2][5]

**Step-by-step fix for QR code noise pattern (broken latent generation):**
1. **Verify models**: Download and place Z-Image Turbo models (bf16 format) in correct ComfyUI directories (e.g., `ComfyUI/models/unet/` for UNet, `ComfyUI/models/clip/` for Qwen/CLIP/Lumina2). Refresh model list in ComfyUI. Use ComfyUI-Manager to update to latest version and install nodes: `rgthree-comfy`, `ComfyUI-GGUF` (for GGUF variants). [1][2][3][4][7]
2. **Load proper workflow**: Import Z-Image Turbo JSON from docs.comfy.org or Amazing Z-Image v3.0 (Dec 2025 release with 15 styles, enhancer). Avoid mismatched SDXL/Stable Diffusion workflows—Z-Image uses AuraFlow sampling. [2][3][4][5]
3. **Set KSampler precisely**:
   | Parameter | Recommended Value | Notes |
   |-----------|-------------------|-------|
   | **Steps** | **6–9** | Turbo optimized for low steps; higher causes over-denoising noise. [1] |
   | **CFG** | **1.0–3.0** | Low CFG prevents guidance collapse into QR patterns. [1] |
   | **Sampler** | **Euler** or **Euler A** | Matches Z-Image architecture; others distort latents. [1] |
   | **Scheduler** | **Simple** | Default for stability; avoid karras/ddim. [1] |
   | **Denoise** | **1.0** (txt2img) | Reduce to 0.2–0.4 for subtle img2img edits. [1] |
   | **Seed** | Randomize | Fix for testing. [1] |
4. **Prompt optimization**: Use short, clear prompts (Z-Image excels at concepts without long SDXL strings). Strong negative prompts (e.g., "blurry, noise, QR code, artifacts"). Add camera styles like "50mm portrait" for better coherence. [1]
5. **Run and troubleshoot**:
   - Queue generations; check console for model load errors.
   - If noise persists: Lower CFG to 1.0, steps to 6; ensure VAE Decode connects properly.
   - Test with Promptus presets or Amazing Workflow's style selector/enhancer for validated outputs. [1][3][4]
6. **Advanced**: Chain LoRAs post-UNet (strength 0.5–1.0) or use custom sigma values in nodes. Outputs auto-save to ZImage folder in v3.0 workflows. [1][3][4]

This resolves QR noise (common from wrong sampler/CFG/model mismatch) yielding photorealistic results with text rendering. Update ComfyUI via Manager for 2026 compatibility. [1][3][4][5][7]
