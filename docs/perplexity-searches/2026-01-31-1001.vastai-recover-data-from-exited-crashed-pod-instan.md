## Search Results

To recover data from an **exited or crashed Vast.ai pod instance**, first check its status (stopped instances preserve disk data), then attempt to restart it using the web console or CLI. If restart fails (e.g., stuck in "SCHEDULING" due to GPU reassignment), access data via logs/directories or copy to a new instance/cloud backup without destroying it[1][3][7].

### Step-by-Step Recovery Process

1. **Check Instance Status and Logs**:
   - In the Vast.ai console, view your instance list for status (e.g., "stopped", "scheduling", "loading").
   - Click **View Logs** for Docker container output to diagnose crashes[1].
   - CLI: `vastai logs <INSTANCE_ID> --tail 1000` (shows last 1000 lines; use `--raw` for JSON)[3].

2. **Restart the Stopped Instance** (preserves data):
   - **Console**: Click the **Restart** (play) button. It enters "SCHEDULING"; wait up to 30s. If stuck longer, GPU is likely unavailable—click **Stop** to cancel[1].
   - **CLI**:
     ```
     vastai start instance <INSTANCE_ID>
     ```
     Or reboot (stop/start cycle without losing GPU priority):
     ```
     vastai reboot instance <INSTANCE_ID>
     ```
     [3].
   - **API** (no direct "start" endpoint shown; use CLI or console). If scheduling fails indefinitely, GPU may be taken by high-priority jobs[1][7].

3. **Access/Recover Files from Disk** (data persists on stopped instances):
   - If restart succeeds: SSH/Jupyter into `/workspace` (default persistent dir)[1][3].
   - If restart stuck: 
     - Create a **new instance** on the same machine (note machine ID from console).
     - Use Vast.ai data movement tools or `vastai cloud copy` to transfer from stopped instance[1][3].
   - **CLI data access** (from stopped state): See data movement docs (linked in CLI stop command)[3].

4. **Set Up Cloud Backups for Future Recovery** (recommended for 2025-2026 workflows):
   - Create connection: `python3 vast.py show connections` (e.g., Google Drive)[4].
   - Schedule backup (e.g., hourly from `/workspace`):
     ```
     python3 vast.py cloud copy --src /workspace --dst /backups/<INSTANCE_ID>_backups/ --instance <INSTANCE_ID> --connection <CONNECTION_ID> --transfer "Instance To Cloud" --schedule HOURLY --day "*" --hour "*"
     ```
     Or cron: `0 */4 * * * python3 vast.py cloud copy ...` (every 4 hours)[4].
   - List/delete jobs: `python3 vast.py show scheduled-jobs`[4].

### Key Warnings
- **Never use Destroy** (`vastai destroy instance <ID>` or API DELETE)—permanently deletes all data[1][2][6].
- Crashed/exited pods often relate to "Loading/Connecting" issues (slow images, port config, offline machines)—try faster machines or report host[1].
- Stopped data incurs storage fees; backup externally[1][6].

If instance is truly destroyed (lifetime expired), data is gone—always backup first[6]. For API-only workflows, combine `vastai show instances` with start/reboot[3]. Test on a small instance.
