## Problem

RunPod pods stuck RUNNING status runtime null not starting January 2026 - platform issue or user configuration problem - workaround solutions


---

## Search Results

RunPod pods stuck in **RUNNING** status with **runtime null** (not starting) in January 2026 are likely a **platform issue** tied to recent outages, rather than user configuration, though node-level problems or resource contention can contribute.[1][5]

### Key Evidence from Recent Status (Jan 2026)
- RunPod's uptime page shows multiple disruptions this month: **US-IL-1 data center issues**, Cloudflare outages (18+ minutes downtime), maintenance (up to 5 hours), and winter weather impacts on Texas data centers (resolved Jan 23).[1]
- No widespread "runtime null" reports, but a user case on Discord describes a pod failing to start due to **host-level GPU issues** (Pod ID: rhk9ikde8bcgza), blocking data access—mirrors your symptoms.[5]
- Platform operational as of Jan 1-6, but degraded performance noted later; check https://uptime.runpod.io for real-time status.[1]

### Diagnosis Steps
1. **Verify pod details in RunPod dashboard**: Note Pod ID, host node, GPU type, and exact error (e.g., "runtime null" often indicates container runtime failure like CRI-O/containerd issues).
2. **Check RunPod status page**: Filter for your data center (e.g., US-IL-1, Texas); recent GPU/host problems align with your timeline.[1]
3. **Inspect logs via SSH/CLI** (if accessible):
   ```
   kubectl describe pod <pod-id>  # If Kubernetes-backed
   kubectl logs <pod-id> -c runtime
   ```
   Look for sandbox creation failures, IOPS throttling, or GPU allocation errors.[2]
4. **Test node health**: High IOWAIT, CPU 100% usage, or low IOPS on burstable VMs can stall pods.[2]

### Workaround Solutions (Test in Order)
| Issue Type | Steps | Expected Outcome |
|------------|--------|------------------|
| **Platform outage/GPU host** [1][5] | 1. Stop pod via dashboard.<br>2. Create new pod on different data center/secure cloud spot (e.g., switch from Texas/US-IL-1).<br>3. Contact RunPod support with Pod ID (Discord/forums fastest). | Pod starts fresh; data recoverable via volumes. |
| **Resource throttling** [2] | 1. Upgrade to higher IOPS disk (e.g., non-burstable VM).<br>2. Reduce CPU requests in template (add kubelet reservations: `--kube-reserved=cpu=1,memory=2Gi`).<br>3. Restart node if visible. | Resolves sandbox/pod init stalls. |
| **Runtime/container stuck** [3] | Edit workflow/runner config to specify executor (e.g., `executor: k8s` in YAML).<br>Restart pod or scale down/up deployment. | Pods transition from perpetual RUNNING. |
| **Data access block** [5] | Mount persistent volume to new pod; request support snapshot. | Retrieve data without original pod. |

If persists post-outage (e.g., after Jan 23 Texas fix), it's probably config—share Pod ID/logs for precise debug. Monitor RunPod Discord for 2026 updates.[5]
