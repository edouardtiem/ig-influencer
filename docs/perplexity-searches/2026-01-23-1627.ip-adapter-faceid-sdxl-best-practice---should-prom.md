## Problem

IP-Adapter FaceID SDXL best practice - should prompt include detailed face description or let IP-Adapter control face features - prompt engineering with face embedding 2025-2026


---

## Search Results

**For IP-Adapter FaceID SDXL, let the IP-Adapter primarily control face features via the Face ID embedding from InsightFace, rather than including detailed face descriptions in the prompt.** This approach leverages the model's strength in extracting and applying facial identity directly from the reference image, producing more consistent and accurate face replication.[1][3]

### Key Best Practices for Prompt Engineering (2025-2026 Workflows)
- **Minimal face details in prompt**: Focus prompts on scene, clothing, pose, lighting, and style (e.g., "A woman in office, white professional shirt"). Avoid specifics like "oval face, blue eyes, sharp jawline" as they can conflict with the embedding, leading to artifacts or dilution of the Face ID effect.[1][3]
- **LoRA integration**: Always use the required LoRA (e.g., `ip-adapter-faceid_sdxl_lora` or `Face ID Plus SDXL`) in the prompt with weight 0.6-1.0: `<lora:ip-adapter-faceid_sdxl_lora:0.8>`. Higher weights (up to 1.3 for FaceID) strengthen face fidelity without over-constraining composition.[1][2][3]
- **IP-Adapter weight tuning**:
  | Model Variant | Recommended Weight Range | Notes |
  |---------------|---------------------------|-------|
  | FaceID SDXL | 0.8-1.3 | Strong face cloning; under 1.0 often optimal for balance.[3] |
  | Plus-Face SDXL | 0.3-1.0 | Lower weights prevent prompt override; good for subtle influence.[1][3] |
  | FaceID Plus v2 SDXL | 0.6-1.0 | Combines InsightFace + CLIP; adjustable CLIP weight for global features.[1] |
- **Reference image prep**:
  1. Use a clear, high-quality face crop or portrait matching the desired angle/pose (e.g., straight-on for front views).[1][3]
  2. For SDXL FaceID, cropped faces improve results, similar to Plus-Face models.[1]
  3. Match source demographics/style to base model (e.g., avoids issues with Asian faces in some tests).[2]
- **Workflow steps (ComfyUI/A1111)**:
  1. Load IP-Adapter FaceID SDXL model + matching LoRA.[1][2]
  2. Apply InsightFace encoder (no specific CLIP Vision needed for SDXL).[2]
  3. Set IP-Adapter weight, generate with neutral face prompt.
  4. Iterate: Increase LoRA/IP weight if face drifts; add ControlNet (e.g., OpenPose) for pose if needed.[4]

**Limitations**: SDXL FaceID may underperform on certain ethnicities (e.g., Asian faces) compared to SD1.5 or Reactor; test with RealVisXL_V3.0_Turbo-like bases for portraits.[2][3] Recent GitHub updates emphasize unified loaders for auto-LoRA handling.[8]
