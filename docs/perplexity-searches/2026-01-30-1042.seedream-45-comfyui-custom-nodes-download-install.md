## Search Results

### Seedream 4.5 ComfyUI Custom Nodes
**Seedream 4.5 integrates into ComfyUI primarily via API-based custom nodes (no local safetensors/GGUF model weights found in 2026 results), using services like BizyAir, Replicate, or fal.ai.** No direct "ComfyUI-Seedream" GitHub repo matches exactly; closest are API wrappers. Download/install nodes below; local model weights unavailable—use cloud APIs.

#### 1. Primary Node: BizyAir Seedream 4.5 (Cloud API, Recommended for Easy Access)
- **Source**: Comfy.ICU node by siliconflow (814 stars, Doubao API backend).[1]
- **Features**: Text-to-image with prompt, size presets (2K/4K/Custom), max_images, optimize_prompt, image input support. Outputs IMAGE.
- **Install Steps** (requires ComfyUI Manager):
  1. Install ComfyUI Manager: In ComfyUI `custom_nodes` folder, run `git clone https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager.git` via CMD.[2][3]
  2. Restart ComfyUI, open Manager (double-click control file), search "BizyAir", install ☁️BizyAir Nodes.[1][3]
  3. Restart ComfyUI. Node appears under ☁️BizyAir/External APIs/Doubao.[1]
- **Model**: Uses `doubao-seedream-4-5-251128` (no local download).[1]
- **Nodes**: Includes SeedreamSampler-like functionality via prompt/model inputs.[1]

#### 2. Alternative: ComfyUI-Seedream4_Replicate (Replicate API)
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/Saganaki22/ComfyUI-Seedream4_Replicate (Seedream 4, adaptable for 4.5).[4]
- **Features**: Prompt, size presets, image-to-image, seed control, multi-image, progress tracking. Supports SeedreamReference via image inputs.
- **Install Steps**:
  1. In ComfyUI `custom_nodes`: `git clone https://github.com/Saganaki22/ComfyUI-Seedream4_Replicate.git`.[4]
  2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (use embedded Python: `python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -r ...`).[3][4]
  3. Get Replicate API key (replicate.com/account/api-tokens).[4]
  4. Restart ComfyUI. Set API key in node.
- **Upgrade Note**: For Seedream 4.5, check repo updates or patch model name in code.[4][5]

#### 3. General ComfyUI Custom Node Install (for Any GitHub Repo)
Use ComfyUI Manager (preferred) or manual git:[2][3]
```
# CMD in custom_nodes folder
git clone <github-repo-url>
cd <node-folder>
python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt  # Windows portable[3]
```
- Manager auto-handles deps, GUI search/install (set security to "nightly" for GitHub direct).[3][6]
- Restart after install.[2][3]

#### Model Weights (Safetensors/GGUF/HuggingFace)
- **No local downloads found**: Seedream 4.5 (ByteDance) is API-only in ComfyUI nodes (Doubao/Replicate).[1][4][5][8]
- Official: seed.bytedance.com/en/seedream4_5 (scaling improvements, multi-image editing; no weights).[8]
- Check HuggingFace for "Seedream 4.5" GGUF/safetensors (none in results); use API nodes instead.[5]

#### Troubleshooting (SeedreamReference/SeedreamSampler)
- **Nodes Missing**: Install BizyAir/Replicate—provides sampler (prompt/model) and reference (image input).[1][4]
- **Broken Workflows**: Use API node wiring; adjust security settings.[5][6]
- **Deps/Errors**: Manual pip in embedded env; restart.[3]
- Test workflow: Load node → set prompt/API → queue prompt.

For 2026 updates, search ComfyUI Manager or GitHub "Seedream 4.5 ComfyUI". RunDiffusion supports security edits for nodes.[6]
