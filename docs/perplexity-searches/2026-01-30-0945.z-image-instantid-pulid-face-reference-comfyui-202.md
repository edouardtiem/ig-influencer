## Problem

Z-Image InstantID PuLID face reference ComfyUI 2026 - Z-Image face identity preservation workflow - Z-Image Qwen image conditioning face transfer


---

## Search Results

I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to your query based on the available search results. While the results contain detailed information about **InstantID**—a zero-shot identity-preserving image generation method that works as a plug-and-play module with diffusion models like Stable Diffusion[1][2]—they do not contain relevant information about Z-Image, PuLID, or their integration with ComfyUI workflows.

From the search results, I can confirm that:

**InstantID** is a tuning-free method that generates customized images with various poses or styles from a single reference facial image[1]. It uses three core components: an ID embedding extracted via a pre-trained face model (antelopev21), a lightweight image adapter with decoupled cross-attention, and an IdentityNet that applies weak spatial conditioning using five facial landmarks[2]. InstantID is compatible with popular pre-trained models like Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL and can be integrated with ComfyUI through community implementations[5].

However, to answer your specific questions about Z-Image's face identity preservation workflow, Qwen image conditioning, PuLID face transfer, or how these technologies integrate together in 2026, I would need search results that directly address these topics. The current results focus primarily on InstantID's architecture and capabilities rather than comparative workflows or newer 2026 implementations involving these other technologies.

If you're looking for information about specific ComfyUI workflows combining these methods, I recommend searching for recent documentation or community implementations from those projects directly.
