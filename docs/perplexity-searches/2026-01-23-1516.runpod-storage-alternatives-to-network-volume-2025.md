## Problem

RunPod storage alternatives to network volume 2025 2026 - persistent storage options - S3 mount - external storage - how to persist data without network volume


---

## Search Results

RunPod's primary persistent storage option is **Network Volume** at $0.07/GB/month (with bulk discounts for 1TB+), but alternatives include mounting external object storage like S3, block storage from cloud providers, or platform-specific persistent disks without relying on RunPod's network volumes.[1][5][6]

### Key Persistent Storage Alternatives for RunPod (2025-2026)
These options enable data persistence across pods, jobs, or sessions, often via mounts, APIs, or integrations. Focus on S3-compatible mounting and external/block storage as requested:

- **S3-Compatible Object Storage Mounts**:
  - Use tools like `s3fs`, `goofys`, or `rclone` to mount AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage (GCS), or MinIO buckets directly into RunPod containers as a filesystem. This avoids Network Volumes entirely for read/write access to large datasets (e.g., models, checkpoints).[4]
  - **Step-by-step setup** (using `s3fs` in a RunPod pod):
    1. Install: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install s3fs`.
    2. Configure credentials: Create `~/.passwd-s3fs` with `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
    3. Mount: `s3fs my-bucket /mnt/s3 -o passwd_file=~/.passwd-s3fs -o url=https://s3.amazonaws.com -o use_cache=/tmp -f`.
    4. Persist across restarts by scripting in your Docker entrypoint or using RunPod's persistent environment variables.
  - Benefits: No egress fees on RunPod for ingress; scales infinitely; cost ~$0.023/GB/month on S3 Standard.[4]
  - Platforms like DigitalOcean and CoreWeave natively support S3-compatible storage with no ingress/egress fees.[4]

- **Cloud Block Storage (Attachable Volumes)**:
  | Provider | Storage Type | Pricing (2025) | Integration with RunPod | Notes |
  |----------|--------------|----------------|--------------------------|-------|
  | Google Cloud Persistent Disk | Block storage (SSD/HDD) | $0.04–$0.17/GB/month | Mount via GCP integration or VPC peering | Top-rated for RunPod; supports up to 64TB/volume.[2] |
  | Microsoft Azure Disk | Ultra Disk/Standard SSD | $0.045–$0.20/GB/month | API/CLI attach to pods | Enterprise-grade; global regions.[2][5] |
  | DigitalOcean Volumes | Block storage | $0.10/GB/month | Direct attach; HIPAA/SOC2 compliant | Includes persistent boot + scratch disks for ML workflows.[4] |

- **RunPod-Compatible Platform Alternatives with Built-in Persistent Storage**:
  - **Thunder Compute**: High-performance block storage; scalable/secure; global DCs. On-demand A100s from $1.99/hr; Kubernetes for orchestration.[5][9]
  - **CoreWeave**: NVMe storage included; InfiniBand networking; persistent volumes standard.[1][4]
  - **Lambda Labs**: $0.15/GB/month persistent storage + snapshots; dynamic vCPU/RAM; VS Code integration.[6]
  - **Northflank/Fluidstack**: Private storage (e.g., 50GB free); API integrations; ComfyUI workflows.[3][4][8]
  - **Vast.ai/Massed Compute**: $0.10–$0.20/GB/month; included bandwidth; Inventory API for programmatic persistence.[3][5]

### Recommendations for 2025-2026 Workloads
- For **cost-sensitive ML training/inference**: S3 mounts + RunPod Community Cloud (no idle charges; per-second billing).[1][3]
- For **enterprise/regulated**: Switch to GCP/Azure block storage or CoreWeave/DigitalOcean for 99.5%+ SLA and compliance.[2][4]
- **Migration Tip**: Export Network Volume data via `rsync` to S3, then mount in new setups. Test cold starts (<200ms on RunPod serverless).[3]
- Limitations: RunPod lacks managed DBs/IoT; advanced networking has a learning curve. Always verify GPU stock via APIs.[3][6]
