## Problem

Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 GGUF Q4_K_M download link CivitAI direct model file safetensors 13GB


---

## Search Results

The **Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 GGUF Q4_K_M** model (approximately 13GB) is available for direct download from the Hugging Face repository `unsloth/Qwen-Image-Edit-2512-GGUF` (note: repo uses 2512 naming convention for the 2511 edit variant).[1][3]

### Direct Download Instructions
1. Visit https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen-Image-Edit-2512-GGUF/tree/main.
2. Select the **Q4_K_M** quantization file: `qwen-image-edit-2511-Q4_K_M.gguf` (or similar naming like `qwen-image-2512-Q4_K_M.gguf` for the edit model).[1][3]
3. Click **Download** for the ~13GB GGUF file (4-bit quantized UNet/diffusion model).[1][2][3]
4. Place in `ComfyUI/models/unet/` for use with ComfyUI-GGUF custom node (install via ComfyUI Manager).[1][2]

### Related Files (Not the Main 13GB Model)
- **VAE**: `qwen_image_vae.safetensors` from the same repo; place in `ComfyUI/models/vae/`.[1][2]
- **Optional Lightning LoRA** (4-step fast generation, ~smaller size, .safetensors format): `Qwen-Image-Edit-2511-Lightning-4steps-V1.0-fp32.safetensors` or `Qwen-Image-Lightning-4steps-V1.0.safetensors`; place in `ComfyUI/models/loras/`.[1][2]
  - No direct CivitAI link found in results; use Hugging Face above.

### Usage Notes
- Requires ~13-14GB VRAM/RAM (combined); runs on RTX 4070-level GPUs.[1][3]
- Update ComfyUI: `git pull` or `update_comfyui.bat`.[1][2]
- No direct .safetensors 13GB GGUF on CivitAI per results; GGUF is native .gguf format.[1][2]

For workflows, load via ComfyUI GGUF loader (e.g., `unsloth_qwen_image_2512.json`).[3]
