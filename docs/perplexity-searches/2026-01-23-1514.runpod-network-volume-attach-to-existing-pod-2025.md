## Problem

RunPod network volume attach to existing pod 2025 2026 - can you attach network volume to running pod - network volume different datacenter than pod - how to use network storage with community cloud GPU

## Search Results

**No, you cannot attach a network volume to a running RunPod pod; it must be specified during pod deployment.**[1][4][6]

### Key Limitations
- **Attachment timing**: Network volumes are attached only at pod creation via the console's Deploy button (under Pods > Deploy > optional network volume selection). They replace the default `/workspace` volume disk and cannot be added, removed, or modified on a live pod.[4][6]
- **Region/datacenter restrictions**: Network volumes are region-specific (e.g., EUR-RO-1) and must match the pod's datacenter. Pods in different datacenters cannot access a volume from another; deploy in the same region.[1][7]
- **No hot-attach support**: Confirmed in community discussions and docs—no updates as of 2025-2026 indicate changes.[1][6]

### Workarounds for Existing Pods (Step-by-Step)
1. **Migrate data to new pod**:
   - Create a new pod in the **same region** as your data needs.
   - First, deploy a temporary "FileBrowser" pod (template: `lkpjizsb08`) with a cheap GPU/CPU to mount the target network volume. Login: `admin`/`admin`. Use its web interface to upload data from your current pod (e.g., via `rsync` or direct transfer).[1]
   - Deploy your main pod selecting the network volume—data is instantly available at `/workspace`.[5][6]
2. **Pod migration feature** (for Secure Cloud):
   - Enable "Automatically migrate Pod data" on termination: It provisions a new pod with matching specs, transfers network volume data if attached, and restarts in an available machine.[5]
3. **Data transfer for large datasets**:
   - Use an intermediary (e.g., download from old pod to local system, upload to FileBrowser-mounted volume). Avoid direct pod-to-volume copy without intermediary.[1]

### Using Network Storage with Community Cloud GPU
- **Supported**: Deploy Community Cloud GPUs (select in Deploy UI) and attach network volumes like Secure Cloud—same process, region-matched.[3][8]
- **Multi-pod sharing**: Multiple pods (GPU/CPU) can mount the same volume simultaneously for data sharing (e.g., models in Stable Diffusion workflows).[3][6][8]
- **Tutorial steps** (from recent guides):
  1. Pods > Deploy > Select Community Cloud GPU > Choose template (e.g., Automatic1111).
  2. Set volume disk size > Select existing network volume (create via Storage > Add Network Volume if needed, pick region/profile).[3][4]
  3. Customize ports/args (e.g., `--share` for Gradio) > Deploy. Access via proxy (e.g., HTTP for WebUI).[3]
- **Best practices**: Use for persistent models/checkpoints across pods. Terminate/redeploy pods freely—data persists.[3][6]

For latest 2026 UI changes, check RunPod console docs directly, as no conflicting recent sources found.[4][6]
