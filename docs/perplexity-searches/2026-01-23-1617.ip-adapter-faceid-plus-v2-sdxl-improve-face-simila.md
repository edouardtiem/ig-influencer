# IP-Adapter FaceID Plus v2 SDXL: Optimizing Face Similarity and Accuracy

To maximize face similarity accuracy with **IP-Adapter FaceID Plus v2 SDXL**, use a **LoRA weight between 0.5 and 0.7**[4], with higher values producing stronger facial consistency effects[1].

## Key Settings for Best Results

**LoRA Weight Configuration**
The LoRA weight is the primary control for face similarity strength. Set it between 0.5–0.7 for optimal balance[4], though values up to 1.0 are possible[1]. Higher weights intensify the facial feature matching but may reduce stylistic flexibility[1].

**Image Preparation**
Prepare reference images by cropping and resizing them appropriately. The **PrepImageForInsightFace** node handles this automatically in ComfyUI workflows, ensuring the face is properly formatted for the InsightFace encoder[3].

**Model Components**
IP-Adapter FaceID Plus v2 SDXL combines two embedding sources[1]:
- **InsightFace**: Extracts precise facial identity features
- **CLIP image embedding**: Captures global facial structure and context

This dual-encoder approach provides superior face similarity compared to single-encoder variants[1].

## Multiple Reference Images

The search results do not provide specific guidance on using multiple reference images simultaneously with IP-Adapter FaceID Plus v2 SDXL. Standard workflows typically use a single reference image passed through the face ID encoder. If you need to blend multiple faces, you would likely need to either generate separate outputs or use external face-blending techniques outside the IP-Adapter pipeline.

## Combine_Embeds Parameter

The search results do not document a `combine_embeds` parameter for this model. You may be referencing a different IP-Adapter variant or a custom implementation. Verify your specific software version (ComfyUI, A1111, etc.) documentation for available parameters.
