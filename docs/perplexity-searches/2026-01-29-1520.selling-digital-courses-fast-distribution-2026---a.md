## Search Results

To achieve the **fastest first 100 sales** of your digital AI course in 2026, target **AI enthusiast communities** on platforms like Indie Hackers, AI-focused Subreddits (e.g., r/MachineLearning), LinkedIn AI groups, and Gumroad/Stan Store launches, while using all-in-one course platforms with built-in marketing for quick distribution. These alternatives bypass saturated channels like Reddit, YouTube Shorts, X/Twitter, Discord, Product Hunt, Hacker News, and TikTok by leveraging marketplaces with ready buyers and low-friction sales funnels.

### Step-by-Step Fastest Path to 100 Sales
1. **Choose a Low/No-Fee Platform with AI Tools & Built-in Audience** (1-2 days setup):  
   Host on **Thinkific** (best overall, free plan or $74/month; unlimited video hosting, AI course outlines, pre-made sales pages for quick validation) or **LearnWorlds** ($29/month; interactive AI videos/quizzes, community features).[1][2][3] Integrate Gumroad or Stan Store for instant digital delivery (0-8% fees, viral sharing).[3][4] Avoid high-fee marketplaces like Udemy initially (revenue share up to 50% on promo sales).[4]

2. **Price for Speed** ($29-97 one-time; bundle with AI templates): Test via pre-made landing pages on Thinkific to validate demand fast.[2]

3. **Target AI Enthusiast Buyers** (where tech/AI crowds already buy):  
   | Platform/Community | Why Fast for AI Sales | Tactics for 100 Sales |  
   |--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|  
   | **Indie Hackers** | Tech builders/AI solopreneurs; high conversion on launches. | Post MVP course launch thread; share AI use-case study. 20-50 sales/week possible.[3] |  
   | **LinkedIn AI Groups** (e.g., AI Engineers, Prompt Engineering) | 1M+ pros seeking tools; direct DMs. | Share free AI teaser → course link; target 500 connections. |  
   | **Gumroad/Stan Store** | Instant viral shares among AI creators; no audience needed. | Launch with 50% intro discount; embed in newsletters. 100 sales in days via shares.[3] |  
   | **r/MachineLearningBuyIt** or AI Discord alternatives (e.g., EleutherAI) | Enthusiast buyers; less moderated. | Cross-post value thread with buy link (avoid pure promo). |  
   | **Skool/Mighty Networks** | AI community-first; paid groups convert 10x faster. | Join/create AI niche group; upsell course inside ($0-49/month).[3] |  

4. **Launch & Amplify** (Day 3+):  
   - Email 100 warm leads from your network/X followers with exclusive discount.  
   - Run $50/day Meta/LinkedIn ads targeting "AI tools" interests (ROAS 5x reported on Thinkific).[1][2]  
   - Offer "first 50 buyers" bonus (AI prompt pack) for social proof. Track via platform analytics.  

**Expected Timeline**: 50 sales in 3-7 days via communities; hit 100 by week 2 with ads/virality. Platforms like Thinkific/Podia report creators hitting $10k/month fast via these funnels.[1][2][4] If no traction, pivot to white-label LMS like FreshLearn for gamified AI courses ($49/month).[2] Test one platform today for quickest results.
