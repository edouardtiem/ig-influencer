## Problem

ComfyUI SDXL body enhancement post-processing nodes - equivalent to CodeFormer for body parts - skin texture detail improvement 2025 2026


---

## Search Results

**For ComfyUI SDXL body enhancement post-processing equivalent to CodeFormer (face restoration), use workflows combining Ultralytics detectors, inpainting detailers, and LoRAs like `肌肉身材_v1.0` for muscle/skin refinement, with DepthAnythingV2 and SegmentAnythingUltra V2 for precise body part masking and texture improvement.**[1][3]

These nodes enable targeted skin texture detail enhancement on body areas (e.g., arms, torso) by detecting regions, inpainting at high resolution, and blending seamlessly—similar to CodeFormer's face upscaling but for full-body realism in SDXL pipelines.[1][3]

### Key Nodes and Step-by-Step Workflow (2025-2026 Compatible)
Install via ComfyUI Manager: **DepthAnythingV2**, **SegmentAnythingUltra V2**, **Ultralytics** (for body part detection), and relevant LoRAs from Civitai.[1][3]

1. **Load and Preprocess Image**:
   - `LoadImage` → `ImageScale` (to 1024x1024 for SDXL).
   - Generate depth map: `DepthAnythingV2` (provides 3D structure for muscle/skin contours).[1]

2. **Detect and Mask Body Parts**:
   - `SegmentAnythingUltra V2` (prompt: "arm, chest, torso" for auto-masking; refine with `GrowMaskWithBlur`).[1]
   - Alternative: **Ultralytics detectors** (e.g., for hands, body, skin areas) to isolate regions like CodeFormer does for faces.[3]

3. **Enhance with LoRAs and Conditioning**:
   - `CLIPTextEncode` (prompt: "detailed skin texture, realistic muscles, bodybuilding").
   - Apply LoRAs: `肌肉身材_v1.0` (strength 0.72 for muscle/skin detail), `XLabs F.1 Realism LoRA_V1` (realism boost).[1]
   - Use **DepthMiDaS V1.1 ControlNet** or **OpenPose** preprocessor for pose-preserving texture fixes without altering proportions.[3]

4. **Inpaint and Detail**:
   - `KSampler` (SDXL base like `基础算法_F.1`) on masked areas.
   - **Detailer nodes** (from Ultralytics workflows): Inpaint detected body parts at final resolution to fix blurry skin, anatomy errors, or low-detail textures.[3]
   - Blend: `ImageComposite+` (seamless merge of enhanced body with original).[1]

5. **Output and Optimize**:
   - Save as PNG via `SaveImage`.
   - VRAM: ≥12GB; use `--highvram` flag. Disable previews for speed.[1]

| Node/Component | Purpose | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| **DepthAnythingV2** | Depth maps for skin/muscle 3D enhancement | [1] |
| **SegmentAnythingUltra V2** | Body part segmentation/masking | [1] |
| **Ultralytics Detailer** | Auto-detect + inpaint skin textures (CodeFormer-like for body) | [3] |
| **肌肉身材_v1.0 LoRA** | Muscle/skin detail boost | [1] |
| **ControlNet (Depth/OpenPose)** | Preserve structure during texture refinement | [3] |

**Example JSON Workflow**: Download muscle enhancement from comfyui.org (adapt for skin by tweaking prompts to "high-detail skin pores, realistic texture"). For full-body detailers, use Civitai's IMG2IMG all-in-one (supports SDXL, Flux integration in 2025).[1][3]

**Tips for 2025-2026**: Pair with SDXL refiner or Flux for superior skin realism; test on 12-24GB VRAM setups. No direct "CodeFormer-body" node exists, but this combo replicates it effectively via inpainting pipelines.[1][2][3]
