## Problem

ComfyUI QwenVL Qwen2.5-VL face refinement workflow 2025 2026 - how to use vision language model for improving face details in SDXL generated images - best settings and workflow position with FaceDetailer IP-Adapter


---

## Search Results

To improve face details in SDXL-generated images using **QwenVL** (or Qwen2.5-VL/Qwen-Image variants) for refinement in ComfyUI, integrate it as a pre-processing or inpainting step **before FaceDetailer + IP-Adapter**. This leverages Qwen's vision-language capabilities for consistent, photorealistic face edits (e.g., via QwenEdit), then passes the output to FaceDetailer for detection/refinement and IP-Adapter for style/pose locking[1][4].

### Recommended Workflow Position
1. **SDXL Base Generation** → Generate initial image (e.g., 1024x1024, 20-30 steps, Euler sampler).
2. **QwenVL/QwenEdit Face Refinement** (pre-detailer) → Use as inpaint or edit node on detected face bounding box. Input: SDXL image + reference face image + prompt like "enhance facial details, add realistic skin pores, maintain identity".
3. **FaceDetailer (Impact Pack)** → Auto-detect/refine faces on Qwen output. Use 2-pass for severe artifacts[2].
4. **IP-Adapter** → Apply after FaceDetailer for face locking (weight 0.6-0.8) using the refined reference[1].
5. **Upscale/Output** → Ultimate SD Upscale or SmallZero for final polish[1].

SDXL Sampler → VAE Decode → QwenEdit Node (ref image + prompt) → FaceDetailer (pipe) → IPAdapterApply → Sampler (denoise 0.4) → VAE Decode → Save
```

Download workflows: QwenEdit consistent face from [YouTube Dec 2025][1]; FaceDetailer examples from ThinkDiffusion[2].

### Best Settings (2025-2026 Updates)
Use **Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct** or **Qwen-Image-2512** with Lightning 8-step LoRA for speed (4-8s per edit on RTX 40-series)[1][4].

| Component | Key Settings | Rationale |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| **QwenEdit/QwenVL** | Steps: 8 (Lightning LoRA); Denoise: 0.6-0.75; Prompt: "photorealistic face, detailed skin texture, sharp eyes"; Ref strength: 0.8[1] | Locks identity fast without LoRA training; boosts realism in faces (Qwen-Image excels here per 2026 tests)[4]. |
| **FaceDetailer** | Detection: Ultralytics (YOLOv8 face); Detailer steps: 20-25; CFG: 4-6; Dilate: 20px (pass 1), 10px (pass 2); Upscale model: 4x UltraSharp[2] | Auto-masks/refines post-Qwen; 2-pass for SDXL artifacts. Prompt wildcard: "detailed face, preserve [expression]"[3]. |
| **IP-Adapter (FaceID/Plus)** | Weight: 0.7; Noise: 0.2; Model: ip-adapter-faceid-plusv2-sdxl[1] | Applies refined face to new poses/angles without drift. |
| **Overall** | Sampler: DPM++ 2M Karras; Steps: 25-35 total; VRAM: 12GB+ (use --lowvram if needed)[7] | Balances speed/quality; Qwen Lightning cuts inference 70%[1]. |

### Step-by-Step Setup
1. **Install Nodes**: ComfyUI-Impact-Pack (FaceDetailer), ComfyUI-QwenVL (or rgthree-comfy for QwenEdit), IPAdapter-Plus[2][5].
2. **Load Qwen Model**: Place `qwen2.5-vl-7b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf` in `ComfyUI/models/clip_vision/`.
3. **Generate Base**: SDXL prompt → image.
4. **Qwen Refinement**:
   - Load image + ref face.
   - QwenEdit node: Text="refine face details realistically", ref_image=your_face.png, steps=8[1].
5. **Detailer Pipe**:
   - FaceDetailer: bbox_threshold=0.5, detailer_pipe from Impact Pack[2].
   - Connect Qwen output as input.
6. **IP-Adapter**: Load ref (Qwen-refined face), apply to detailer output.
7. **Run & Iterate**: Queue prompt; adjust denoise if faces blur (lower to 0.5).

This yields consistent, pore-textured faces (e.g., "AI influencer" style) without training. For multi-angle batches, chain with @icekiubAI's workflow[1]. Test on 2026 Qwen-Image-2512 for +20% face realism[4]. If VRAM issues, quantize to Q4_K_M.
