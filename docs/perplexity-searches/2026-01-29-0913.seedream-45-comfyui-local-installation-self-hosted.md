### Step-by-Step Local Installation of ComfyUI for Seedream 4.5 (2026)

**Seedream 4.5 is a ByteDance image generation model compatible with ComfyUI via custom nodes and GGUF weights; install ComfyUI locally first, then add Seedream-specific custom nodes and download GGUF model weights for self-hosted workflows.**[4][6] Use the ComfyUI Manager for easy custom node handling and workflow fixes.[1][2]

#### 1. System Requirements
- **NVIDIA GPU** (recommended for speed; 8GB+ VRAM ideal for Seedream 4.5 GGUF models).
- Windows/Linux/macOS; Python 3.10+; Git installed.[1][2]

#### 2. Install ComfyUI Locally (5-15 Minutes)
Follow these methods from 2025-2026 tutorials:

**Portable Installer (Easiest for Beginners):**
- Download the latest ComfyUI portable build from GitHub releases (Windows: ~132MB .zip).[2][3]
- Extract to a folder (e.g., `C:\ComfyUI`).
- Run `run_nvidia_gpu.bat` (NVIDIA) or `run_cpu.bat` (CPU-only).[2]
- ComfyUI launches at `http://127.0.0.1:8188`.[1]

**Manual Git Install:**
```
git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI.git
cd ComfyUI
# Install Python 3.10+ if needed (python.org)
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows; source venv/bin/activate on Linux/Mac
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121  # CUDA 12.1 for NVIDIA
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
Access at `http://127.0.0.1:8188`.[1]

**Stability Matrix (Multi-Tool Manager):**
- Download Stability Matrix from GitHub releases.[3]
- Install ComfyUI package via its interface; enables portable mode and easy custom nodes.[3]

#### 3. Install ComfyUI Manager (Essential for Custom Nodes)
- In ComfyUI terminal (or `custom_nodes` folder):  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager.git custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Manager
  ```
- Restart ComfyUI; Manager button appears in interface.[1][2]
- Use Manager > "Install Missing Custom Nodes" for workflows.[1][2]

#### 4. Seedream 4.5 Custom Nodes & GGUF Model Setup
- **Custom Nodes:** Load a Seedream 4.5 JSON workflow (drag-drop into ComfyUI).[4]
  - Manager detects missing nodes (e.g., Seedream-specific loaders); click "Install" and restart.[1][2][4]
  - Key nodes handle GGUF quantization for local efficiency.[4]
- **Download GGUF Weights:**
  - Get Seedream 4.5 GGUF from Hugging Face (search "Seedream-4.5-GGUF" or ByteDance repo mirrors).[6]
  - Place in `ComfyUI/models/unet/` or `checkpoints/` (per workflow).[1][4]
  - Example workflow nodes: Load GGUF > Prompt > Sampler > VAE Decode.[4]
- **Fix Broken Workflows:** Import JSON template from guides; Manager auto-resolves nodes.[4]

#### 5. Run Seedream 4.5 Workflow Locally
```
# In ComfyUI interface:
1. Drag Seedream JSON workflow.
2. Set prompt (e.g., multi-subject edits).[6][9]
3. Select GGUF model in loader node.
4. Queue Prompt → Generates locally/self-hosted.
```
- Test small resolution first (512x512); upscale with nodes like SeedVR if needed.[7]
- For API-like local use: Enable `--listen` flag in `main.py`.[4]

#### Troubleshooting
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Missing nodes | Manager > Install Missing > Restart.[1][2] |
| CUDA errors | Verify `nvidia-smi`; reinstall torch with CUDA 12.1.[1] |
| Slow GGUF | Use Q4_K_M quantization; CPU fallback via `--cpu`.[2][6] |
| Workflow fails | Update nodes via Manager; check Z-Image blog for Seedream 4.5 JSON.[4] |

This setup runs fully offline/self-hosted. For cloud alternatives (no local install), see RunDiffusion/Floyo.[5][8] Sources are 2025-2026 current.[1][2][4][6]
