# ComfyUI Ultralytics Detailer Node Setup for SDXL

The **Ultralytics Detailer** workflow integrates face and body detection into your SDXL pipeline by using the UltralyticsDetectorProvider to identify regions, then applying enhancement through FaceDetailer nodes[1][2].

## Installation Requirements

Before setting up the workflow, install these components[1][2]:

- **ComfyUI Impact Pack** — Search "impact" in the Manager's Install Custom Nodes and select ComfyUI Impact Pack
- **ComfyUI-Impact-Subpack** — Required separately to access the UltralyticsDetectorProvider node (not automatically included in newer versions)[2]
- **Ultralytics Models** — Install face and person detection models (e.g., `face_yolov8m.pt` for bbox detection)[1]

After installation, restart the ComfyUI UI for changes to take effect[1].

## Pipeline Placement and Node Arrangement

The Ultralytics Detailer integrates into your workflow after the base image generation[1]:

1. **Base Generation** — Your standard SDXL KSampler output
2. **UltralyticsDetectorProvider** — Loads detection models to identify faces, hands, and person regions[3]
3. **FaceDetailer (pipe)** — Applies enhancement to detected face regions[1][2]
4. **Optional: Ultimate SD Upscale** — Upscales the enhanced output[1]

The nodes connect via **pipe architecture**: `ToBasicPipe` → `BasicPipe -> DetailerPipe` → `FaceDetailer (pipe)` → `KSampler (pipe)`[1]. Connect outputs to inputs matching their names (e.g., DETAILER_PIPE outputs connect to DETAILER_PIPE inputs)[1].

## Settings for Body and Skin Enhancement

For skin and body enhancement[1][3]:

- **UltralyticsDetectorProvider**: Select detection models including "face," "hand," and "person" segments
- **bbox_detector**: Use `face_yolov8m.pt` for facial bounding box detection[1]
- **Base Model**: Use realistic models like "Epic Photogasm" or similar for quality skin rendering[1]
- **FaceDetailer (pipe)**: Applies iterative refinement to detected regions for enhanced detail[2]

For multi-pass enhancement, use **FaceDetailer (Double Pass)** workflow, which applies the detailer twice for compounded improvements[1].

## Workflow Execution

After arranging nodes according to the pipeline structure[1]:

- Ensure all model downloads complete (or skip with a `skip_download_model` file in `custom_nodes/`)[2]
- Connect the detection provider output to the FaceDetailer input
- Run the prompt — the detailer automatically processes detected regions without manual masking[1][2]

For SDXL-specific refinement, use **FromDetailer (SDXL/pipe)** and **BasicPipe -> DetailerPipe (SDXL)** nodes to leverage the refiner model[2].
