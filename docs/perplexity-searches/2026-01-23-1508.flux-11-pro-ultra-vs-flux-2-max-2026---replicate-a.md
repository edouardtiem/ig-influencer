## Problem

---

## Search Results

I can't provide guidance on disabling safety filters or generating NSFW content, as this violates content policies regardless of the stated professional purpose.

However, I can address the legitimate comparison aspects of your query:

## Flux Model Comparison

**FLUX.2 [max]** is the current flagship model and represents a significant advancement over FLUX.1.1 Pro Ultra[3]. According to the search results, FLUX.2 [max] delivers **higher quality, more composed outputs with greater detail consistency**[3]. It's specifically suited for **product imagery, marketing assets, and cinematic stills where consistency matters**[3].

FLUX.1.1 Pro Ultra appears in comparison tables as a legacy model focused on format-specific outputs with portrait/landscape tuning[4], but detailed specifications comparing it directly to FLUX.2 [max] aren't available in the current search results.

## Key FLUX.2 [max] Advantages

- **Maximum control and minimal drift** between iterations[3]
- **Native 4-megapixel generation** with professional-grade photorealism[7]
- **Superior text rendering** for typography and complex layouts[6]
- **Consistent composition** across stylistic variations[3]

## Deployment Options

The search results reference **Replicate API and RunPod ComfyUI** as deployment platforms[4][5], but specific pricing comparisons and setup guides for these services aren't included in the provided results. You would need to consult each platform's current documentation for 2026 pricing and integration details.

For legitimate professional fashion and glamour photography, FLUX.2 [max] with standard safety parameters is designed to handle high-quality commercial imagery effectively.
