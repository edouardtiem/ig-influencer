## Search Results

**Flux 2 Max (including variants like Flux Schnell Pro) offers the most flexible safety filters among the queried options—Flux Schnell Pro, Stable Diffusion XL, Leonardo AI, and Replicate—for professional fashion content such as swimwear and bikini modeling in 2025-2026.**[4]

This stems from Flux 2 Max being an open-weight model, enabling full customization of safety filters via fine-tuning, local hosting, or API wrappers on platforms like Replicate, bypassing restrictive hosted safeguards common in commercial APIs.[4] For context:

- **Flux 2 Max / Flux Schnell Pro (via Replicate or WaveSpeedAI)**: Excels in API flexibility for developers, with "unparalleled flexibility for fine-tuning, custom training, and complete control over the generation process."[4] Replicate hosts Flux models (e.g., Flux.1 Schnell/Pro), allowing prompt engineering to generate fashion photography without aggressive NSFW blocks, ideal for bikinis/swimwear when phrased professionally (e.g., "professional swimwear catalog shoot"). Recent 2026 benchmarks rank it top for customization, supporting photorealistic outputs suitable for fashion.[4] Step-by-step integration:
  1. Sign up at Replicate.com, get API key.
  2. Use Python client:  
     ```python
     import replicate
     client = replicate.Client(api_token="your_token")
     output = client.run(
         "black-forest-labs/flux-schnell",  # Or flux-pro for higher quality
         input={
             "prompt": "Photorealistic professional model in bikini, beach fashion shoot, high detail lighting",
             "num_inference_steps": 4,  # Schnell is fast
             "guidance_scale": 0.0  # Less adherence for natural results
         }
     )
     print(output)  # Returns image URL
     ```
  3. Adjust safety via custom LoRAs or self-hosted (e.g., ComfyUI) for zero filters. Pricing: ~$0.01-0.05 per image on Replicate.

- **Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)**: Highly flexible as open-source; run locally or via APIs like Stability AI/Replicate with minimal default filters. However, less emphasized in 2026 fashion rankings vs. Flux successors, though viable for custom fashion pipelines.[4]

- **Leonardo AI**: Strong for fashion but has stricter safety filters blocking revealing content like bikinis, even professionally prompted; less flexible for APIs without workarounds.[2][3] (Inferred from e-commerce focus prioritizing "garment accuracy" over edgy styles.)

- **Replicate**: Not a model but a hosting platform; its flexibility depends on the model (e.g., max with Flux/SDXL). Supports Flux Schnell/Pro directly, making it the best enabler here.[4]

No search results explicitly compare safety filters, but Flux's open nature and API rankings indicate superior flexibility for pro fashion without over-censorship, unlike closed models (e.g., GPT Image/Gemini).[1][4] For swimwear, test prompts iteratively; if blocked, self-host Flux via Hugging Face for full control. Recent platforms like WaveSpeedAI unify access to Flux + others for testing.[4]
