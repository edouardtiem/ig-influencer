## Problem

Qwen-Image-Edit-2512 CivitAI download GGUF model alternative 2025 2026


---

## Search Results

Based on the search results, **Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 is the current editing model available in GGUF format**, not Qwen-Image-Edit-2512[1][2]. The December 2025 release focused on Qwen-Image-2512 for text-to-image generation, while the editing capabilities are provided by the Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 variant.

## Downloading GGUF Models

You can download Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 GGUF from **Hugging Face** through the Unsloth collection[1][2]. The recommended quantization level is **Q4_K_M**, which balances quality and memory efficiency[1].

**File placement for ComfyUI:**
- Place the GGUF diffusion model in: `ComfyUI/models/unet/`
- Example filename: `qwen-image-edit-2511-Q4_K_M.gguf`[1]

## Key Specifications

The GGUF versions use **Unsloth Dynamic 2.0 methodology**, which selectively upcasts critical layers to higher precision while keeping less sensitive layers at lower precision[1]. This allows the model to run on systems with as little as 8GB VRAM, compared to the original BF16 model's 48GB+ requirement[1].

## Setup Requirements

You'll need three essential components for the editing workflow[1]:
- GGUF diffusion model (UNet)
- Text encoder (can be GGUF format)
- VAE (typically safetensors format)

Ensure you update ComfyUI to the latest version for proper GGUF support before installation[1].
