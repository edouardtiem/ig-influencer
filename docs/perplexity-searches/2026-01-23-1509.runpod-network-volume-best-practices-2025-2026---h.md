## Problem

RunPod network volume best practices 2025 2026 - how to use network volume with community cloud pods - persistent storage across pod restarts - which datacenters support both network volumes and GPUs


---

## Search Results

**Network volumes in RunPod provide persistent storage that survives pod terminations and can be shared across multiple pods**, making them ideal for storing large models and datasets without re-downloading them for each new deployment[1].

## Key Use Cases

Network volumes are best suited for[1]:

- **Persistent data**: Storage that remains accessible after pods are terminated or Serverless workers stop
- **Shareable storage**: Attaching the same volume to multiple pods or endpoints
- **Portable storage**: Moving your working environment between different compute resources
- **Efficient data management**: Avoiding repeated downloads of large models or datasets, which reduces cold start times

## Setup with Community Cloud Pods

To attach a network volume to a pod[1]:

1. Navigate to the Storage page in the RunPod console and click **New Network Volume**
2. Select your desired datacenter and provide a descriptive name
3. Specify the volume size in gigabytes
4. When deploying a pod, select **Network Volume** and choose your volume from the dropdown
5. The volume will mount at `/workspace` by default, though you can adjust the mount path in the pod template

When you attach a network volume to a pod, **worker deployments are constrained to the datacenter where the volume is located**[1]. To improve GPU availability and reduce downtime, you can attach multiple network volumes across different datacenters, with each worker receiving one volume based on its assigned datacenter[1].

## Datacenter Compatibility

**Datacenter location does not affect pricing, but determines which GPU types and endpoints your network volume can be used with**[1]. The system automatically displays available GPU options once you select a network volume, ensuring compatibility between your chosen datacenter and GPU availability.

## Cost Considerations

Network volumes cost **$0.07/GB/month for volumes under 1TB**[9], compared to pod volume storage at $0.10/GB/month when running and $0.20/GB/month when idle[9]. This makes network volumes more economical for long-term persistent storage[8].

## Data Migration Between Datacenters

For large data transfers between network volumes in different datacenters, **use `rsync` over SSH on two running pods** for faster migration speed and greater reliability[1]. This approach is preferable to manual copying for substantial datasets.
