## Problem

ComfyUI SDXL reduce grain noise in generated images 2025 2026 - best techniques samplers VAE settings post-processing denoising


---

## Search Results

To reduce **grain noise** (also called artifacts or graininess) in ComfyUI SDXL-generated images, use lower **denoising strength** (0.15-0.4), optimized **samplers** like DPM++ 2M Karras or Euler a, high-quality **VAE** models, SDXL refiner workflows, and targeted **post-processing** like detailers or low-denoise img2img upscaling.[1][2][3][4]

### Step-by-Step Techniques (2025-2026 Best Practices)
1. **Sampler Settings for Cleaner Outputs**:
   - Choose samplers that converge faster with less noise: **DPM++ 2M Karras** (20-30 steps, CFG 7-8) or **Euler a** (25-40 steps) for SDXL base models. Avoid high-step ancestral samplers like DPM++ SDE, which amplify grain.[2]
   - In KSampler node: Set **steps: 25-35**, **CFG: 6-8**, **denoise: 0.75-0.85** for initial text-to-image (lower denoise retains structure, reduces over-noising).[1][3]
   - Workflow tip: Load SDXL base checkpoint, add T5-based text encoders for crisp prompts (handles long prompts better, less artifacting).[2]

2. **VAE Optimization**:
   - SDXL's default VAE can introduce grain; switch to **sdxl_vae.safetensors** (from official Hugging Face) or **vae-ft-mse-840000-ema-pruned** for sharper decoding with less noise.[1][2]
   - In workflow: Use **VAE Decode** after sampling. For SDXL, encode/decode at 1024x1024 native resolution (sweet spot for color/contrast without grain).[2]
   - Test: If grain persists, bake VAE into checkpoint via ComfyUI manager (2025 updates support this natively).[6]

3. **Denoising Strength Control (Core Noise Reducer)**:
   - Never use **denoise=1.0** in img2img or upscaling—it fully noising the latent, destroying fidelity.[3]
   - For refinement: **0.15-0.3** in secondary KSampler (e.g., img2img on initial output) preserves details while smoothing grain. Example: Denoise 0.15 returns "exact image back" with subtle cleanup.[5]
   - SDXL Base + Refiner: Run base at denoise 0.8 (rough shapes), refiner on last 20-30% latent (denoise 0.2-0.4) for "clean crisp output" without grain.[1][2]

4. **Post-Processing Workflows**:
   - **Detailer Chain (Impact Pack)**: Detects faces/objects, redraws with **denoise 0.2-0.5** and **bbox threshold 0.5**. Chain face → hand → full image for sequential noise reduction. Enable Color Match to fix shifts.[4]
   - **Low-Denoise Upscaling**: Upscale latent by 1.5-2x (Upscale Image node), then KSampler **denoise 0.2-0.4**. Keeps original while denoising grain.[3]
   - **Face Detailer + Refiner**: Load SDXL base/refiner, set img2img denoise 0.3 on faces only. Bypasses full re-generation.[1]
   - **Inpaint for Grainy Areas**: Mask noisy regions (right-click → MaskEditor), inpaint with denoise 0.3-0.4.[4]

### Quick Comparison of Techniques
| Technique | Denoise Range | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|-----------|---------------|------|------|----------|
| Sampler Tweak | N/A | Fast, no extra nodes | Limited for heavy grain | Initial gen[2] |
| VAE Swap | N/A | Global sharpness | Model-specific | All SDXL[1] |
| Refiner Pass | 0.2-0.4 | Crisp details | 2x compute | Portraits[1][2] |
| Detailer | 0.2-0.5 | Targeted fixes | Needs Impact Pack | Faces/hands[4] |
| Low-Denoise Upscale | 0.15-0.3 | Smooth upscale | Slight detail shift | Final polish[3][5] |

Test iteratively: Generate → img2img (denoise 0.25) → Detailer. Recent 2025 ComfyUI updates (e.g., Flux/SD3.5 compat) enhance this, but SDXL remains reliable for low-grain photorealism.[2][6] For code/debug, check ComfyUI GitHub for node inputs.
