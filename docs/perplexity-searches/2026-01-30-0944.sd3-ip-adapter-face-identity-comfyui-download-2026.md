### Download Links for SD3 IP-Adapter Face Identity Models

The primary model file for **ComfyUI InstantX IP-Adapter for SD3.5 Large** (face identity/style transfer) is **`ip-adapter.bin`** (sometimes referenced as `ip-adapter_sd3_face.bin` or `ip_sd35l_instantx.bin`). Download it from the original InstantX repository on Hugging Face and place it in `ComfyUI/models/ipadapter/` (rename for clarity, e.g., `ip-adapter_sd3.bin`).[4]

- **Required companion file**: `siglip_vision_patch14_384.safetensors` (CLIP vision model) – also place in `ComfyUI/models/clip_vision/`.[3][4]
- **Compatible checkpoint**: `SD3.5-L.safetensors` or Turbo variant (Large preferred for face identity accuracy).[1][4]

No 2026-specific updates found in results; these are current as of early 2026.

### Installation Steps for ComfyUI
1. **Install custom node**: Clone `ComfyUI-InstantX-IPAdapter-SD3` via ComfyUI Manager (search "InstantX IPAdapter SD3") or Git: `git clone https://github.com/Slickytail/ComfyUI-InstantX-IPAdapter-SD3` into `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/`.[2][4]
2. **Download models** as above and restart ComfyUI.
3. **Key nodes**: `IPAdapterSD3Loader`, `CLIPVisionLoader`, `CLIPVisionEncode`, `ApplyIPAdapterSD3` (weight ~0.5 for face identity).[1][2]

### Ready-to-Use Workflows (Z-Image/DiT Compatible)
- **SD3.5L IP-Adapter Workflow** (face/style transfer, DiT-based SD3.5 architecture): Download JSON from https://comfyai.run/download/workflow/SD3.5L%20IP-Adapter%20Workflow/33af7216-0df0-6eab-2596-834ec3876214. Drag into ComfyUI; supports text prompt + reference image (e.g., face.jpg) → IPAdapter application → KSampler output.[1]
- **Example workflow in repo**: Check `workflows/` folder in GitHub repo for SD3.5 Large/Turbo JSON (Z-Image latent compatible via `EmptySD3LatentImage`, `VAEDecode`).[4]
- **Style Transfer Workflow**: https://www.mimicpc.com/workflows/sd35-ipa (upload face image, prompt, queue).[7]

**DiT/Z-Image Compatibility**: SD3.5 uses DiT (Diffusion Transformer) architecture with triple-CLIP conditioning. This IP-Adapter unifies face identity into UNet/model conditioning via `ApplyIPAdapterSD3` node, fully compatible with SD3.5 workflows (no separate Z-Image adapter needed).[1][2][5]

### Example ComfyUI Workflow Snippet (Face Identity)
```
- Load Checkpoint: SD3.5-L.safetensors
- Load Image: your_face.png
- CLIPVisionEncode (siglip model)
- IPAdapterSD3Loader: ip-adapter.bin
- ApplyIPAdapterSD3: model, ipadapter, image_embed, weight=0.5
- CLIPTextEncode: "portrait of [face] in cyberpunk style"
- KSampler → VAE Decode → SaveImage
```
Test with image weight 0.5 for strong face preservation.[1][4]

For issues: Ensure models in correct folders; Turbo has lower face accuracy.[3][4] Run online at ComfyAI/Comfy.ICU for no-install testing.[1][2]
