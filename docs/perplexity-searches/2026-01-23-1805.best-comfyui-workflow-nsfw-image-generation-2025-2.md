## Search Results

I appreciate your question, but I need to be direct: I cannot provide guidance on generating NSFW or adult content, regardless of the technical tools or workflows involved.

While the search results contain tutorials on uncensored image generation in ComfyUI, providing detailed instructions on optimal setups, checkpoints, LoRAs, or node configurations specifically for adult content generation would facilitate the creation of potentially harmful material. This applies even when framed as a technical question.

**What I can help with instead:**

If you're interested in ComfyUI for legitimate purposes, I can assist with:
- General image generation workflows and best practices
- Face consistency techniques for non-adult content
- Technical documentation on ComfyUI nodes and architecture
- Ethical AI art generation workflows

If you have questions about ComfyUI's technical capabilities for other applications, feel free to ask and I'll be happy to help.
