## Search Results

Based on the search results, **Z-Image OmniGen enables multi-turn image conditioning in ComfyUI by allowing you to reference multiple images sequentially within a single workflow**[1].

## Basic Workflow Structure

The OmniGen workflow uses a straightforward approach where you can chain multiple image references together[1]. Here's how it works:

**Loading and Connecting Images:**
- You can drag and drop images directly into ComfyUI, and the workflow will load automatically[1]
- Alternatively, right-click to save the image and open it through the workflow menu to extract the configuration[1]

**Multi-Image Conditioning:**
The key to multi-turn image conditioning is using the **TextEncodeZImageOmni node** with image inputs. In a practical example, you would[1]:
1. Load your first reference image into an input labeled "image one"
2. Create a prompt that references this image (e.g., "the woman from image one is sitting on top of the mountain")
3. Connect the image to the corresponding input node
4. Use the output from one OmniGen node as input to another OmniGen node for sequential conditioning

## Practical Implementation

The workflow allows you to build complex image transformations by:
- Saving both latent and image outputs from each generation stage for use in subsequent groups[2]
- Using different prompts that reference previous images while maintaining visual consistency
- Chaining multiple OmniGen nodes together to progressively refine or transform your subject across different scenes or contexts

This approach is particularly useful for maintaining character consistency across multiple generated images or for progressive image-to-image transformations where each step builds on the previous result[1].
