## Problem

Seedream 4.5 ComfyUI face reference image consistency workflow 2026 - how to use reference image for face identity preservation in Seedream 4.5 local ComfyUI - character consistency node


---

## Search Results

To achieve **face identity preservation** in Seedream 4.5 using a local ComfyUI workflow with a reference image, integrate the Seedream 4.5 API or custom nodes into your ComfyUI setup, leveraging its multi-reference capabilities (up to 10 images) for consistent facial features, lighting, and details across generations.[1][2][4][5]

### Step-by-Step Workflow Setup in Local ComfyUI
1. **Install Seedream 4.5 Integration**: Use a ComfyUI custom node pack like ComfyUI-Seedream (check GitHub repos for 2026 updates) or API wrappers to load the ByteDance Seedream 4.5 model. Fix common broken workflows by updating dependencies and API keys from ByteDance Seed.[1][3] Download from https://seed.bytedance.com/en/seedream4_5.[4]

2. **Load Reference Image Node**: Add a **Load Image** node for your face reference (e.g., a clear portrait). Connect it to a **Seedream Reference Input** or **Multi-Reference** node. Seedream 4.5 preserves facial structure, identity, and tones from references—specify "keep face unchanged" in prompts.[2][4][5][7]

3. **Configure Character Consistency Node**:
   - Use or install a **Face Identity** or **Reference Preservation** node (e.g., IPAdapter-like for Seedream, or custom ComfyUI-Impact-Pack adaptations).
   - Inputs:
     | Parameter | Setting | Purpose |
     |-----------|---------|---------|
     | Reference Image | Your face photo | Anchors identity[2][5] |
     | Strength/Weight | 0.8-1.0 | High for strict face lock-in[5] |
     | Prompt | "Keep [description] facial features, outfit unchanged; [new action/scene]" | Explicit preservation[2] |
     | Batch/Sequence Mode | Enable (Max 6 outputs) | Consistent sets via "series" keyword[2] |
   - Output connects to **Seedream 4.5 Sampler** node for generation.[1][6]

4. **Prompt Engineering for Consistency**:
   - Base: "Generate [pose/scene] referring to reference face, preserve exact facial features, lighting, and expression."
   - Iterate: Use follow-ups like "Same face, change background to futuristic city."[2]
   - Multi-ref: Blend up to 10 images (e.g., face + style); prompt "Face from image 1, style from image 2."[2]

5. **Run and Refine**:
   - Set resolution to 2K/4K, aspect ratio to match reference.[2][6]
   - Generate batch (up to 6 images) for views/sequences: "Same girl from reference, front/side/back views."[2]
   - Debug: If drift occurs, increase reference weight or add "strict identity preservation."[5]

### Example ComfyUI JSON Snippet (Adapt to Your Workflow)
```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {"id":1, "type":"LoadImage", "inputs":{"image":"your_face_ref.png"}},
    {"id":2, "type":"SeedreamReference", "inputs":{"ref_image":1, "strength":0.9}},
    {"id":3, "type":"SeedreamSampler", "inputs":{"prompt":"Keep face from ref, jumping in puddle", "ref":2, "steps":30}}
  ]
}
```
This mirrors API workflows; test in ComfyUI manager for Seedream-specific nodes.[1]

For full face consistency in edits, combine with inpainting nodes targeting non-face areas.[3][7] If local API limits hit, fallback to cloud like RunDiffusion.[3] Check 2026 ComfyUI forums for latest **Seedream 4.5 character consistency node** updates.[1][5]
