## Problem

Z-Image Lumina S3-DiT model face consistency LoRA training 2026 - can SDXL LoRAs work with Z-Image? How to train custom LoRA for Z-Image architecture? Face identity preservation solutions for Z-Image ComfyUI


---

## Search Results

I don't have sufficient information in the search results to comprehensively answer your multi-part question about Z-Image LoRA training, SDXL compatibility, and face consistency solutions.

## What the search results cover:

The available sources confirm that **Z-Image is a 6B-parameter foundation model using the S3-DiT architecture**[1][2], and that it achieves **sub-second inference on enterprise GPUs while fitting within 16GB VRAM on consumer hardware**[2]. The model supports **text-to-image and image-editing tasks with instruction-following capabilities**[2].

However, the search results do not address:

- **SDXL LoRA compatibility** with Z-Image (SDXL uses a different architecture than S3-DiT, making direct compatibility unlikely, but this isn't explicitly confirmed in the sources)
- **Custom LoRA training procedures** for Z-Image's S3-DiT architecture
- **Face identity preservation techniques** specific to Z-Image
- **ComfyUI integration** for Z-Image workflows

## What I can infer:

Since Z-Image uses a **unified single-stream architecture that processes text, visual semantic, and image tokens together**[1], rather than the dual-stream design of SDXL, LoRAs trained for SDXL would not be directly compatible. However, this is inference beyond the provided sources.

To get accurate answers on LoRA training for Z-Image, you would need to consult:
- The official Z-Image documentation or GitHub repository
- Community forums or Discord servers dedicated to Z-Image development
- Recent technical papers or blog posts on S3-DiT fine-tuning (published after November 2025)
