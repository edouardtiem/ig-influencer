### Selling AI Workflow Tutorials in 2026

To sell digital products like **AI workflow tutorials** (e.g., ComfyUI courses or Claude AI automation), use platforms like **Gumroad**, **Patreon**, or **Stripe** for payments and delivery; price courses at **$47–$497** based on depth, promote ethically on Reddit via value-first posts, and integrate automated delivery for downloads.[3][5]

#### Platform Comparison: Gumroad vs. Patreon vs. Stripe
Choose based on your model—**one-time sales** (Gumroad/Stripe), **subscriptions** (Patreon), or **custom sites**. Here's a breakdown:

| Platform | Best For | Fees (2026 est.) | Key Features for Digital Tutorials | Drawbacks |
|----------|----------|------------------|------------------------------------|-----------|
| **Gumroad** | One-off digital downloads (e.g., ComfyUI course videos/PDFs) | 10% + payment processing (Stripe/PayPal) | Instant delivery, EU VAT handling, email lists, upsells; no monthly fees | Limited community tools |
| **Patreon** | Recurring access (e.g., ongoing Claude AI updates) | 5–12% + processing | Membership tiers ($5–$50/mo), Discord integration, exclusive content | Subscription churn; less for one-time sales |
| **Stripe** (via own site/WordPress) | Custom storefronts with downloads | 2.9% + $0.30/transaction | Full control, webhooks for automation (e.g., Zapier delivery), subscriptions | Requires dev setup; no built-in marketing |

**Recommendation**: Start with **Gumroad** for simplicity—upload tutorials, set prices, and automate delivery via email links. Integrate Stripe for lower fees if scaling to a site. Patreon suits if offering monthly workflow templates.[3][4]

**Step-by-Step Setup for Digital Downloads**:
1. Create product: Zip course files (videos, prompts, ComfyUI JSON workflows).
2. Upload to Gumroad/Patreon; enable "pay what you want" minimum ($29).
3. Add Stripe for payments; use webhooks to trigger download links (e.g., via Make.com at $10.59/mo).[1]
4. Automate fulfillment: Connect to n8n ($24/mo self-host) for post-purchase emails with secure links.[4]
5. Test: Ensure mobile delivery and refunds work.

#### ComfyUI Course Pricing & Claude AI Automation Market
- **ComfyUI courses**: Price **$97–$297** for beginner-to-advanced (e.g., node-based workflows, custom nodes). Bundle with templates for $197 upsell. Market demand high for Stable Diffusion automations.[1][2]
- **Claude AI automation courses**: **$147–$497** reflecting ROI (e.g., "10x time savings"). Value-based: Charge for outcomes like "automate 10hr/wk workflows" at $5k+ agency equiv., but digital at 10–20% of that.[3][5][6]
- **General benchmarks**: AI tutorials sell at $47 intro, $197 full-course. Agencies charge $10k–$50k for custom workflows, so position yours as "DIY agency alternative" for 80% margins.[3][5]

| Course Type | Low-End Price | High-End Price | Example Value Prop |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| ComfyUI Basics | $47 | $97 | 20+ templates, setup guide |
| Claude Automation | $147 | $497 | ROI calculator, live workflows |
| Full AI Workflow Bundle | $297 | $997 | Multi-tool (n8n, Relay.app) integration |

#### Reddit Promotion Rules & Strategies
Reddit bans overt sales (r/ComfyUI, r/ClaudeAI, r/Automate enforce strictly). Follow rules:
- **Allowed**: Share free value (e.g., "Free ComfyUI workflow tip saved me 2hrs—full tutorial link in comments"). Post in r/SideProject, r/Entrepreneur, r/digitalnomad.
- **Banned**: "Buy my course!" titles. No affiliate spam; disclose if selling.
- **Strategy**:
  1. Build karma: Post 5–10 free tutorials first.
  2. Use AMAs or "Show r/ComfyUI" for feedback.
  3. Drive to Gumroad via bio/pinned comment.
  4. Cross-post to r/AI, r/MachineLearning (check megathread rules).
- Expected: 10–20% conversion from 1k views; aim for 100 sales/mo at scale.[3]

#### Payment Processing for Digital Downloads
Use **Stripe** core (2.9% fees) with Gumroad wrappers. For high-volume:
- Automate with Pipedream ($45/mo Basic: 20M AI tokens for delivery bots).[2]
- Global: Handles VAT/MOSS; add webhooks for instant access.
- Security: Time-limited links via Relay.app ($27/mo).[1]

Scale with retainers ($200–$1,500/mo for updates) per YouTube pricing guides.[6] Track ROI: 40% margins post-fees on $10k/mo sales realistic for niche AI tutorials.[3]
