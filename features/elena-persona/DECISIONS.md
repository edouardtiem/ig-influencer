## 2026-01-23: Gleeful Wife Persona Pivot

**Context**: Needed to differentiate Elena from generic Instagram models and create a compelling narrative for audience engagement.

**Options considered**:
1. "Bored wife" (sad, lonely, melancholic) → Tested, felt too negative
2. "Gleeful wife" (happy, free, enjoying) → More appealing, positive energy
3. "Hotwife" (explicit on all platforms) → Too risky for Instagram

**Decision**: Gleeful Wife with Two-Tier Strategy
- Instagram: Suggestive hints, safe for algorithm
- Fanvue: Full hotwife, provocative

**Reason**: 
- "Gleeful" is more attractive than "sad bored wife"
- Two-tier protects IG from shadowban
- Creates strong conversion funnel to Fanvue

**Result**: Full persona rewrite implemented across all files

## 2026-01-23: No Hardcoded Locations

**Context**: Initially created list of "priority locations" for the concept.

**Decision**: Let Perplexity choose locations dynamically, apply narrative prism after

**Reason**: Hardcoded locations limit creativity and trending opportunities. Better to keep dynamic content selection and just add the "gleeful wife" framing to whatever location is chosen.

**Result**: Removed priority location lists, kept only narrative prism instructions

## 2026-01-23: Expression Requirements

**Context**: Initial "bored" concept led to contemplative/sad expressions in generated images.

**Decision**: Mandate happy/gleeful expressions, ban sad/contemplative

**Allowed**: "radiant happy smile", "eyes sparkling", "playful grin", "mischievous smirk"
**Banned**: "contemplative", "bored", "lonely", "pensive", "sad"

**Reason**: The character should visually communicate joy, not sadness. She's winning at life.

**Result**: Updated all prompt templates with expression requirements
