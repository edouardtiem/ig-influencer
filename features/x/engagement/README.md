## Strategy

Grow followers through **manual engagement** — liking and replying to posts from similar accounts. This is what worked on Instagram before DM automation got us banned.

## DM Strategy

**No automation.** When someone DMs:

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| "Hey" / casual | "Hey! I'm more active on Fanvue 💋" |
| Asking for content | "Check my Fanvue for the good stuff 👀" |
| Spam | Ignore |

---

## Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Followers | +100/week initially |
| Profile visits | Track in X Analytics |
| Link clicks | Track via Fanvue referrals |
| Engagement rate | 3-5% |

---

## What NOT to Do

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Auto-like tools | Banned, will get suspended |
| Auto-reply bots | Banned, same as Instagram |
| Mass follow/unfollow | Triggers spam detection |
| Same reply to everyone | Flagged as bot behavior |
| Excessive liking (500+/day) | Rate limited |

---

## Tools (Optional, Manual)

| Tool | Purpose | Safe? |
|------|---------|-------|
| TweetDeck | Multi-column view | ✅ Yes |
| X Analytics | Track performance | ✅ Yes |
| Hypefury | Scheduling only | ✅ Yes |
