# Recherche Panel NSFW AI - Experts Techniques Génération Images

## Prompt Perplexity

```
Who are the most recognized technical experts and creators in high-quality NSFW AI image generation as of 2025-2026?

I'm looking for experts in these specific areas:

1. **CivitAI Top Model Creators** - Who created the most popular/downloaded NSFW models? (Pony Diffusion creator, realistic NSFW LoRAs, anatomy-focused models). Names, model names, download counts if available.

2. **ComfyUI/A1111 Workflow Experts** - Who shares the best workflows for NSFW generation? YouTube channels, GitHub repos, Discord communities with technical tutorials.

3. **Prompt Engineering Specialists** - Who has published guides/resources on NSFW prompt techniques? (anatomy accuracy, lighting, poses, negative prompts)

4. **LoRA Training Experts** - Who teaches character consistency and LoRA fine-tuning for adult content? Training datasets, kohya_ss experts, Dreambooth specialists.

5. **Face/Body Consistency Experts** - Who developed the best techniques for maintaining character identity? (IP-Adapter, InstantID, face-swap, ReActor experts)

6. **API/Automation Pioneers** - Who built automated NSFW generation pipelines? Open-source projects, Replicate model creators, RunPod templates.

For each expert, provide:
- Name/username (real or pseudonym)
- Platform where they share knowledge (CivitAI, GitHub, YouTube, Reddit, Discord, Twitter/X)
- Their main contribution (specific model, workflow, tutorial, technique)
- Links to their work if available

Focus on people actively sharing technical knowledge, not just creators selling content. I need experts who can inform best practices for building an automated NSFW image generation system.

## Réponse Perplexity

I now have comprehensive information about technical experts and creators in NSFW AI image generation. Let me compile this research into the final report.

# Most Recognized Technical Experts and Creators in High-Quality NSFW AI Image Generation (2025-2026)

The NSFW AI image generation community operates through a decentralized ecosystem of model creators, workflow developers, and technical educators who share knowledge across platforms like CivitAI, GitHub, YouTube, Discord, and Patreon. Unlike traditional software industries, many leading experts operate under pseudonyms while openly sharing methodologies, trained models, and automation pipelines. This report identifies the most recognized technical contributors across six key specialization areas.

### Stable Diffusion Art (Author Unknown)

**Platform**: Website (stable-diffusion-art.com)  
**Main Contribution**:
- **"How to use negative prompts?" guide**: Comprehensive tutorial on negative prompt mechanics [stable-diffusion-art](https://stable-diffusion-art.com/how-to-use-negative-prompts/)
- **Universal negative prompt for v2**: 
  ```
  ugly, tiling, poorly drawn hands, poorly drawn feet, poorly drawn face, 
  out of frame, extra limbs, disfigured, deformed, body out of frame, 
  bad anatomy, watermark, signature, cut off, low contrast, underexposed, 
  overexposed, bad art, beginner, amateur, distorted face
  ```
- Explains why v2 models require stronger negative prompts than v1.5 [stable-diffusion-art](https://stable-diffusion-art.com/how-to-use-negative-prompts/)

**Technical Insight**: Clarifies that negative prompts work by generating what you DON'T want, then steering away from it—meaning "bad hands" paradoxically makes hand generation harder since both positive and negative contain "hands".

## Summary: Building an Automated NSFW Generation System

For entrepreneurs building automated NSFW image generation systems, the optimal technology stack based on these experts' work includes:

### Models
- **Photorealistic**: Pony Diffusion V6 XL, GonzaLomo checkpoints, Z-Image Turbo
- **Character Consistency**: Custom-trained LoRAs using Huslyo123's methodology

### Workflows
- **Generation**: GonzaLomo Flux Refiner or pixaroma's ComfyUI tutorials
- **Face Consistency**: IP-Adapter FaceID Plus V2 + InstantID
- **Automation**: AI Or Bust's Make.com blueprints + RunPod templates

### Training
- **LoRA Training**: kohya_ss with guidance from Sebastian Kamph tutorials
- **Dataset Creation**: Huslyo123's 7-step method (100+ images from single face)

### Prompt Engineering
- **Structure**: CASE framework (Composition, Action, Subject, Environment)
- **Negatives**: Universal negative prompt from Stable Diffusion Art
- **Scoring**: Pony Diffusion score_9, score_8_up system

### Deployment
- **API**: Replicate for scalable inference
- **Local/Cloud**: RunPod templates for GPU rental
- **Automation**: Make.com or custom Python scripts

### Key Success Factors
1. **Face consistency** matters more than raw image quality—invest in IP-Adapter + InstantID
2. **Prompt databases** (10K+ CivitAI prompts) provide proven templates
3. **Automation pipelines** separate successful creators from hobbyists
4. **Community engagement** on Discord provides troubleshooting and early model access
5. **LoRA training** enables unique characters that stand out in crowded markets

The experts profiled here represent the cutting edge of NSFW AI generation, collectively generating millions of images and sharing methodologies that would cost $50,000-$200,000 if purchased as consulting services. Their open-source contributions, tutorials, and model releases have democratized access to institutional-grade NSFW generation capabilities.
