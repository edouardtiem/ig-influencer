# Archive — Documentation V1

> ⚠️ **ARCHIVED** — Do not use unless specifically asked

This folder contains the old documentation structure (before 23 January 2026).

---

## What's Here

| Folder | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| `sessions/` | 70+ session log files (date-prefixed) |
| `roadmap/` | Old task tracking (done/, in-progress/, todo/, bugs/, ideas/) |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Old full roadmap file |

---

## Current Documentation

The active documentation is now in:

```
/features/
├── instagram/{dm, content-brain, comments}/
├── fanvue/{dm, posting, pipeline}/
├── comfyui-generation-workflow/
├── conversion-tracking/
└── elena-persona/

/ROADMAP-v2.md          ← Current roadmap
/SESSION-PROMPTS.md     ← Session start/end prompts
```

---

## Why Archived?

The old structure had information scattered across multiple places:
- Feature status in `roadmap/in-progress/`
- Session logs in `docs/sessions/`
- Decisions buried in session files

The new structure groups everything by feature for easier navigation.
